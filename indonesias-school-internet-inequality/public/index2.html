      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Indonesia continues to grapple with a significant digital divide in education, with many schools still lacking internet access. The gap is especially stark between urban centers and remote regions while schools in major cities are mostly connected, those in isolated provinces often remain offline. This disparity severely limits learning opportunities for millions of students, particularly in public schools, which tend to lag behind their private counterparts.      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to bring these inequalities to light through visual storytelling, encouraging data driven policy responses. By using interactive choropleth maps and small multiples, we will illustrate regional differences and compare internet access across various school levels, from elementary to special education. Users will be able to explore the public-private divide through dynamic filters, while tooltips will offer detailed insights such as unmet needs in each province.      </p>

      <h2>Project Goals and Structure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Section 1: Real Wages in Seattle</strong><br>
          <em>Goal</em>: Reveal how wage trends in key industries have evolved when adjusted for inflation.<br>
          <em>Approach</em>: Interactive line charts will display real vs. nominal wage growth across sectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Section 2: What is Driving the Cost of Living?</strong><br>
          <em>Goal</em>: Break down which components - housing, food, transportation - are contributing most to cost increases.<br>
          <em>Approach</em>: Stacked area charts and interactive category filters will highlight disparities in price growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Section 3: Affordability Over Time</strong><br>
          <em>Goal</em>: Translate economic metrics into real-world meaning by showing what a paycheck can buy today compared to the past.<br>
          <em>Approach</em>: Ratio-based visuals will illustrate how many eggs, gallons of gas, or square feet of rent an hour of work buys.
